# About Me

I’m a systems-minded builder who moves fast but never skips the foundation. I prioritize clean structure, reliable functionality, and performance that feels effortless. I write code that should still make sense 6 months from now.

## 🔧 What I Optimize For

- **Clarity over cleverness** – I prefer simple, modular solutions.
- **Responsiveness** – I deeply care about perceived speed and use virtualization, deferred rendering, and caching naturally.
- **Scalability** – I build assuming future growth, not current constraints.
- **Maintainability** – I refactor constantly. DRY, modular, clean.
- **Empathy-driven UX** – If it annoys me as a user, I fix it as a dev.

## 🛠️ How I Work

- I ship functionality first, then polish.
- I don’t write “good enough” code — I write code that stays good.
- I debug methodically, optimize carefully, and abstract responsibly.
- I don’t over-engineer, but I never under-architect.
- I expect my teammates to care — about the user, the system, and each other.

## 🤝 Collaboration Style

- I value clear communication, async-friendly workflows, and shared ownership.
- I give direct, constructive feedback — and I welcome it the same way.
- I’d rather fix root causes than patch symptoms.

## 🤖 AI-First Programming

I treat AI tools as collaborators — from scaffolding and refactoring to test coverage and UX review. I build faster, debug smarter, and think broader with AI in the loop.
